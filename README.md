## Description 

- A deep reinforcement learning agent using the Deep Q-Learning algorithm is built from scratch 
- deployed to play the “Blackjack-v1” [game from the Open AI gymnasium.](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/blackjack/)
- The aim is for the agent to learn an optimal policy that maximises its chances of winning against a dealer for each round played.
- Pytorch is used to build and train the Deep neural network used within the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.
- Double Deep Q learning also built and implemented
- performance is compared to an agent using blackjack basic stratergy
